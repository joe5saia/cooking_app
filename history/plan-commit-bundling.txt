Goal: Provide a commit bundling plan for cookctl scaffold changes that keeps .beads/issues.jsonl in sync.

Scope in worktree:
- New cookctl entrypoint + internal packages.
- Config/credentials/client/app changes for cookctl commands.
- Docs: README, docs/cookctl.md, history/cooking-cli-product.md.
- Build target updates in backend/Makefile.
- Beads issue log updates.

Plan A (single commit; simplest + beads-safe):
1) One commit containing all code + docs + build + beads changes.
   - Pros: .beads/issues.jsonl stays consistent; no partial state.
   - Cons: large commit.

Plan B (two commits; if you want separation):
1) Commit code + build:
   - backend/cmd/cookctl/
   - backend/internal/cookctl/
   - backend/go.mod
   - backend/go.sum
   - backend/Makefile
2) Commit docs + beads:
   - docs/cookctl.md
   - history/cooking-cli-product.md
   - README.md
   - .beads/issues.jsonl

Note: If splitting into more than two commits, you must reconcile .beads/issues.jsonl changes per commit, which is usually not worth the complexity.
